# 404 Error Diagnostic Tools

This directory contains diagnostic tools to help identify and resolve HTTP 404 errors in the React SPA.

## Available Tools

### 1. diagnose-404.js
Comprehensive diagnostic tool that analyzes:
- Build output (dist folder, index.html, assets)
- Server configuration (vercel.json)
- Route configuration (App.tsx)
- Provides recommendations for fixes

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run diagnose
```

### 2. test-routes.js
Route testing utility that validates all application routes:
- Tests route accessibility
- Identifies which routes return 404 errors
- Can test against local preview server or deployed site

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test against running server
npm run test:routes

# Test with local preview server (starts server automatically)
npm run test:routes:preview

# Test against specific URL
node scripts/test-routes.js https://your-deployed-site.com
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Missing dist folder
**Symptom:** "Dist folder does not exist" error
**Solution:** Run `npm run build` to generate the build output

### 2. Missing SPA rewrite rules
**Symptom:** Routes return 404 in production but work locally
**Solution:** Ensure vercel.json has proper rewrite rule:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Build configuration issues
**Symptom:** Assets not loading or incorrect paths
**Solution:** Check vite.config.ts for proper base path and build settings

### 4. Route configuration problems
**Symptom:** Specific routes not working
**Solution:** Verify routes are properly defined in App.tsx with React Router

## Troubleshooting Workflow

1. **Run Diagnosis:** `npm run diagnose`
2. **Fix Critical Issues:** Address any critical configuration problems
3. **Test Locally:** `npm run test:routes:preview`
4. **Build and Deploy:** `npm run build` then deploy
5. **Test Production:** `npm run test:routes https://your-site.com`

- Run diagnosis before deployment
- Test routes after deployment
- Monitor route health in production
