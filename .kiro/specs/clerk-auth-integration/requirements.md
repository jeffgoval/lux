# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating Clerk authentication system into the existing React Vite application to provide secure user authentication and authorization. The integration will replace or complement the current authentication system with Clerk's modern, developer-friendly authentication solution that includes sign-in, sign-up, user management, and session handling capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Clerk authentication into the React Vite application, so that I can provide secure and modern authentication capabilities to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Clerk React SDK is installed THEN the application SHALL have access to all Clerk authentication components and hooks
2. WHEN the environment is configured THEN the application SHALL use the VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY from .env.local file
3. WHEN the ClerkProvider is implemented THEN it SHALL wrap the entire application in main.tsx
4. IF the publishable key is missing THEN the application SHALL throw a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in and sign up for the application, so that I can access protected features and maintain my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display SignInButton and SignUpButton components
2. WHEN a user clicks the sign-in button THEN the system SHALL present Clerk's sign-in interface
3. WHEN a user clicks the sign-up button THEN the system SHALL present Clerk's sign-up interface
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the main application
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to manage my account and sign out, so that I can control my session and account settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the UserButton component
2. WHEN a user clicks the UserButton THEN the system SHALL show account management options
3. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the afterSignOutUrl configured path
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to conditionally render content based on authentication state, so that I can show different UI elements to authenticated and unauthenticated users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing protected routes THEN the system SHALL use SignedIn component to wrap authenticated-only content
2. WHEN implementing public content THEN the system SHALL use SignedOut component to wrap unauthenticated-only content
3. WHEN a user's authentication state changes THEN the UI SHALL update automatically to reflect the new state
4. WHEN checking authentication state programmatically THEN the system SHALL provide reliable hooks and utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to secure environment variables and configuration, so that sensitive authentication keys are not exposed in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing the Clerk publishable key THEN it SHALL be placed in .env.local file with VITE_ prefix
2. WHEN the application builds THEN real keys SHALL NOT be included in tracked files
3. WHEN sharing code examples THEN only placeholder values SHALL be used
4. WHEN configuring git THEN .env* files SHALL be excluded via .gitignore

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that users receive clear feedback when authentication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Clerk components encounter errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network issues occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL show specific validation errors
4. WHEN authentication services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback messaging
