# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The client management system is currently non-functional with multiple critical issues preventing basic CRUD operations. The system needs a complete overhaul to provide a professional, working client management interface with full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality connected to the Appwrite backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Functional CRUD Operations

**User Story:** As a clinic administrator, I want to create, view, edit, and delete client records, so that I can manage my client database effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Novo Cliente" THEN the system SHALL open a modal with a complete client creation form
2. WHEN I fill out the client form with valid data THEN the system SHALL save the client to Appwrite database
3. WHEN I submit the form THEN the system SHALL show success notification and refresh the client list
4. WHEN I click on a client card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the client details page
5. WHEN I edit a client THEN the system SHALL update the record in Appwrite and show confirmation
6. WHEN I delete a client THEN the system SHALL remove the record from Appwrite after confirmation
7. IF there are validation errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Working Service Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly implemented service layer, so that the application can communicate with Appwrite backend reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is initialized THEN it SHALL connect to Appwrite without compilation errors
2. WHEN creating a client THEN the service SHALL properly transform form data to Appwrite format
3. WHEN retrieving clients THEN the service SHALL return properly formatted client objects
4. WHEN updating a client THEN the service SHALL merge existing data with new changes
5. WHEN deleting a client THEN the service SHALL remove the record and handle errors gracefully
6. IF network errors occur THEN the service SHALL provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 3: Real-time Data Integration

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want to see real client data from the database, so that I can work with actual information instead of mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the clients page THEN the system SHALL fetch real data from Appwrite
2. WHEN I create a new client THEN it SHALL appear in the list immediately
3. WHEN I update a client THEN the changes SHALL be reflected across all views
4. WHEN I delete a client THEN it SHALL be removed from all lists immediately
5. IF the database is empty THEN the system SHALL show appropriate empty state
6. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 4: Professional UI/UX

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want an intuitive and professional interface, so that I can manage clients efficiently without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with buttons THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback
2. WHEN forms have errors THEN they SHALL highlight problematic fields clearly
3. WHEN operations are processing THEN the system SHALL show loading states
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL show success/error notifications
5. WHEN I use the search function THEN it SHALL filter clients in real-time
6. WHEN I apply filters THEN they SHALL work correctly with the backend data

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a clinic administrator, I want proper data validation and error handling, so that I can trust the system with sensitive client information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter invalid email format THEN the system SHALL show validation error
2. WHEN I enter duplicate email THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and show error
3. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL prevent submission
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN I enter invalid phone format THEN the system SHALL format it automatically
6. WHEN I enter invalid CPF THEN the system SHALL show validation error

### Requirement 6: File Upload Functionality

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want to upload client photos and documents, so that I can maintain complete client records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a client photo THEN it SHALL be stored in Appwrite storage
2. WHEN I upload documents THEN they SHALL be associated with the client record
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error message
4. WHEN files are too large THEN the system SHALL prevent upload and show size limit
5. WHEN I remove uploaded files THEN they SHALL be deleted from storage
6. WHEN viewing client details THEN uploaded files SHALL be displayed properly
