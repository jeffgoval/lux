# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create diagnostic tools for 404 error analysis



  - Build a diagnostic script that checks build output, server configuration, and route accessibility
  - Create utility functions to validate dist folder contents and index.html integrity
  - Implement route testing functionality to identify which specific routes are failing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Validate and fix build configuration






  - Analyze current vite.config.ts for SPA-specific settings
  - Add proper base path configuration if missing
  - Implement build validation script to ensure proper output generation
  - Fix any asset path issues in the build process
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Fix server configuration for SPA routing
  - Validate vercel.json rewrite rules syntax and effectiveness
  - Test current rewrite configuration against actual routes
  - Update server configuration to handle all client-side routes properly
  - Add fallback handling for unmatched routes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [ ] 4. Implement comprehensive route testing
  - Create automated tests for all defined routes in App.tsx
  - Test both public and protected routes accessibility
  - Validate that authentication redirects work correctly
  - Ensure 404 handling works for truly non-existent routes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 5. Add error monitoring and logging
  - Implement client-side error tracking for 404 errors
  - Add logging for failed route attempts
  - Create error reporting mechanism for deployment issues
  - Build dashboard for monitoring route health
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 6. Create deployment validation script
  - Build script to validate deployment before going live
  - Test critical routes post-deployment
  - Verify asset loading and availability
  - Implement rollback mechanism if validation fails
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 7. Enhance NotFound component and error handling
  - Improve the existing NotFound component with better UX
  - Add proper error boundaries for route-related errors
  - Implement user-friendly error messages and recovery options
  - Add navigation helpers to guide users back to working routes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 8. Optimize build process for production
  - Review and optimize Vite build configuration for SPA deployment
  - Implement proper chunking strategy for better loading
  - Add build-time validation for route configuration
  - Create production-ready build pipeline with error checking
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.2_
